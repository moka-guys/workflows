# Docker directory

This directory should contain a subdirectory per tool, with each subdirectory containing a Dockerfile for that tool, 
and the scripts/resources required, with a README explaining tool installation/usage. 

# Image storage 

Store the zipped tarball of each image in 001_Tools. Images should be referenced using project-XXX:file-XXX and run 
using the immutable SHA(256) hash.
